Saha, A. (2015). Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and More!. No Starch Press.

Removing the need for tedious arithmetic and accounting from
problem solving in math, Saha's book provides a way for the
experienced programmer to tackle more advanced concepts.  The
unit on Calculus was particularly edifying, in which Python was
used to provide intuition into derivatives, limits, and integration.

Please see the Python notebook included in this repository for an example
of the material one may encounter in the book.  I highly recommend the Python
notebook format as a way to document this type of learning.
